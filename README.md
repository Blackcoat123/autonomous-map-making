This project demonstrates how to use **TurtleBot3** with **ROS 2**, **Gazebo**, **SLAM**, and **navigation** to autonomously explore a custom maze environment. Below are the step-by-step instructions to set up and run the simulation.

## âœ… Prerequisites

- ROS 2 (e.g. Humble or later) installed and sourced.
- TurtleBot3 packages installed:
  - `turtlebot3`
  - `turtlebot3_simulations`
  - `nav2_bringup`
  - `slam_toolbox`
  - `explore_lite`
- Gazebo simulator installed and working.
- Set the environment variable:

```bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
```

---

## ðŸš€ Step 1 â€“ Launch the Custom Maze World

Start Gazebo with your custom map (maze environment) and spawn the TurtleBot3 robot.

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo world1.launch.py
```

âœ” This will open Gazebo and load your custom world along with the robot at a predefined location.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 2 â€“ Start Navigation Stack

Bring up the Navigation2 stack to allow path planning and obstacle avoidance.

```bash
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py
```

âœ” This enables autonomous navigation, allowing the robot to plan and follow paths to goal points in the environment.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 3 â€“ Start SLAM for Mapping

Run SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to dynamically build the map as the robot explores.

```bash
ros2 launch slam_toolbox online_async_launch.py
```

âœ” The robot will start mapping the environment while keeping track of its position.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 4 â€“ Visualize in RViz

Launch RViz to visualize the robot, map, sensor data, and navigation paths in real-time.

```bash
rviz2
```

âœ” Use RViz to debug and monitor the robotâ€™s pose, sensors, and navigation.

---

## ðŸš€ Step 5 â€“ Enable Autonomous Exploration

Start exploration using the `explore_lite` package. The robot will autonomously explore the environment and build the map.

```bash
ros2 launch explore_lite explore.launch.py
```

âœ” The robot will roam around, avoid obstacles, and explore unknown areas efficiently.

---

## ðŸ“š Additional Notes

- âœ… **Order Matters**: Launch Gazebo â†’ Navigation â†’ SLAM â†’ RViz â†’ Exploration.
- âœ… **SLAM vs Navigation**: SLAM builds the map while Navigation plans paths on that map.
- âœ… **RViz is Essential**: Visualize the robotâ€™s pose, sensor data, and navigation goals.
- âœ… **Set Environment Variable**: Ensure `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger` is set before running commands.
- âœ… **Custom Maps**: You can design mazes with corridors and obstacles for testing navigation algorithms.
- âœ… **Logging & Debugging**: Use terminal outputs and RViz to monitor behavior and diagnose issues.
- âœ… **Extendibility**: Integrate AI, reinforcement learning, or extra sensors for advanced robotics projects.
